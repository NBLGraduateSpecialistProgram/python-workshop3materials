Materials for Python Workshop 3 (Data Visualization and Machine Learning with Python), created for Data Services at the Rutgers-New Brunswick Libraries.

Please download the files in this repository to a directory you can access through Jupyter Notebook. We will be using the "Wkshp3_Part1_DataVizMachLearn.ipynb", "UScensusdata_50states.txt" and "saxs_scatter.txt" files in the first half of the workshop, and the "Wkshp3_Part2_DataVizMachLearn.ipynb" file in the second half. The other .ipynb files are provided for your reference and include the same content with coding output included. To open the .ipynb files, use Jupyter Notebook which comes with the Anaconda distribution of Python (recommended), or if you already have Python installed, you can follow these instructions to install Jupyter: http://jupyter.org/install.html.

The materials in the Part2 notebooks were adapted from the "SciPy 2017 Scikit-learn Tutorial" by Alexandre Gramfort and Andreas Mueller. Additionally, the images in the Figure folder were reproduced from the same source.
